Pascal Triangle


v1 is version 1 
finding particular element at given row number and given column number
v2 is version 2 
for given row number, printing all row elements
v3 is version 3
for given row number n,
printing all rows from 1 to n rows

Optimal versions are optimized time complexity codes
